Two weeks ago, sports producer Amy Bergstrom came to me with a simple request: let's figure out a way to "dress up" this spreadsheet.

Well, one could say we did that. [Here is the final result](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/flatpages/sports/olympics/2012/seattle-washington-london-2012-olympics.html).

It's a Django solution, flattened out and sent to Amazon S3 with the wonderful [django-bakery](http://datadesk.latimes.com/posts/2012/03/introducing-django-bakery/).

Between all the bureaucracy that comes with working in a large news organization, [we assembled a dream team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbledore's_Army): web designer [Dean Kramer](https://twitter.com/deanohyeah), sports producer [Amy Bergstrom](https://twitter.com/amylbergstrom) and associate producer [Lauren Rabaino](https://twitter.com/laurenrabaino). These people are stunners.

And I have to say, this is my favorite clip yet.
