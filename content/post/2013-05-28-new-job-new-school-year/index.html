<p>It’s not every day that you get to write your own job description, but the good folks at the Star Tribune let me do just that.</p>
<p>After a short summer gig in New York, I’ll be heading back to the Strib as more than an intern (but still not full-time, so I can finish my degree). Take a look at the job posting we decided on.</p>
<p><strong>Digital news developer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pitch, report on and build standalone interactive editorial content for StarTribune.com and mobile platforms</li>
<li>Be available to provide preliminary data and statistical analysis services to reporters and editors (at the discretion of his or her self, and that of his or her editor)</li>
<li>Work with developers on large-scale projects with editorial stake, such as live election results</li>
<li>Improve mobile experiences by communicating technical advice between designers and developers</li>
<li>Develop open source newsroom tools to improve workflow for digital content beyond written articles and traditional multimedia</li>
<li>Develop open source software to capture, analyze and display data</li>
<li>Build the Star Tribune’s presence in the open source community</li>
</ul>
<p>If that isn’t a wonderful job, I don’t know what is. I’m in for a wild ride in my next few months.</p>
