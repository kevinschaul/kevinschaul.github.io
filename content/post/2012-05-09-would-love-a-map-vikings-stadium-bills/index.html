<p>The last few days have been bewildering for anyone following the Vikings stadium debacle. Late last night, the Minnesota Senate passed a version of a bill, and the night before, the House did the same. As I watched Tweetdeck fill in with updates all day, one tweet came called me to action:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinschaul"><span class="citation">@kevinschaul</span></a> Would love a map! (Probably too much to ask for on quick turnaround). <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Vikings&amp;src=hash">#Vikings</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mnleg&amp;src=hash">#mnleg</a>

<p>I got to work. Well, I actually went to my machine architecture final exam (don’t worry, I aced it) (jinx) and <em>then</em> started the map. Once the Senate passed their version, I made a csv file of votes and threw it onto a second map.</p>
<p>See the maps <a href="http://www.kevinschaul.com/projects/vikings-bill-voters/house/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The votes aren’t too interesting in terms of location, but we wouldn’t know until we tried.</p>
<p>If you want to build something like this, <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/data/2012/03/how-we-built-same-day-registration-map">my tutorial for MinnPost</a> would do well.</p>
<p>And as always, you can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/vikings-bill-voters">my GitHub</a>.</p>
