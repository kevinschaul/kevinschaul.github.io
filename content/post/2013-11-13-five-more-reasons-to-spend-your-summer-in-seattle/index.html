title: "Five more reasons to spend your summer in Seattle"
---



<p>Last year’s intern Jon Schleuss nailed <a href="http://www.jschleuss.com/2013/11/13/why-you-should-spend-your-summer-in-seattle/">the top five reasons to spend
your summer in
Seattle</a>.
Here’s my lame attempt to make it a top ten list.</p>
<div id="if-youre-passionate-youre-qualified" class="section level3">
<h3>10. If you’re passionate, you’re qualified</h3>
<p>I came in to the office with mediocre programming skills and a
lackluster understanding of real-world journalism. As the media world
changes, the desire to learn is the differentiating skill; the rest is
secondary.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-already-have-family-in-seattle" class="section level3">
<h3>9. You already have family in Seattle</h3>
<p>The people at the Seattle Times are unbelievably welcoming, friendly and
helpful. Sure, they have their quirks, but what family doesn’t? I moved
there without knowing a soul in the state. I’m a shy person. But
somehow, the folks at work got me out nearly every weekend. I’ll never
lose contact with them; that isn’t something many internships can offer.</p>
</div>
<div id="theyre-serious-about-digital-journalism" class="section level3">
<h3>8. They’re serious about digital journalism</h3>
<p>It’s clear that the Seattle Times management is realizing that data
journalism is a big deal. There’s now a team dedicated to producing
great digital journalism, headed up by <a href="https://twitter.com/laurenrabaino">one of the industry’s best</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="attend-meetings-change-your-major" class="section level3">
<h3>7. Attend meetings, change your major</h3>
<p>I learned more about journalism by going to the daily news meetings than
in my two years of journalism coursework. (I ended up dropping the major
completely after I realized I had been involved in the kinds of
decisions my professors lectured about.) My bosses didn’t mind if I
wasn’t producing something to help the company’s bottom line. It was a
learning experience through-and-through.</p>
</div>
<div id="bring-your-pet-projects-and-watch-them-grow" class="section level3">
<h3>6. Bring your pet projects and watch them grow</h3>
<p>Large companies aren’t known for flexibility and openness to experiment,
but my coworkers helped me find a way to disrupt their routine. I told
my boss about <a href="http://kevin.schaul.io/2012/08/22/seattle-times-election-guide/">my pie-in-the-sky project
idea</a>,
and we executed it <em>without tradeoffs</em>. Talk about getting great clips.</p>
<p>Still not convinced? Take a look at <a href="http://www.jschleuss.com/2013/11/13/why-you-should-spend-your-summer-in-seattle/">Jon’s
reasons</a>, and drop us a line. We rarely bite.</p>
