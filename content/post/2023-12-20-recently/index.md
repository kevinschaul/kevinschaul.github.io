Getting on the "Recently" blog post train. Time will tell how long this lasts ...

## Listening

Been seeing a lot of love for Yussef Dayes's debut solo record: [Black Classical Music](https://yussefdayes.bandcamp.com/album/black-classical-music). It's fantastic. But for even more electric drumming, for me it's hard to beat his live set at Joshua Tree:

## Coding

My chess bot is officially better than I am. That is not saying much. But its rating has ticked up to 1160. So now I've got to get better!You can [play it here](https://lichess.org/@/badchess_bot) and [see the code here](https://github.com/kevinschaul/badchess).

I really should write up a longer post on what I've learned about chess programming. It's been a good new hobby. Lots of interesting algorithmic and data problems embedded in it. If you're a programmer, I really think it's worth giving it a shot -- even writing a bad engine has been quite rewarding.

## Reading

A ton of board books. My favorite so far is [Little Hoot](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/little-hoot_amy-krouse-rosenthal_jen-corace/299352/#edition=4518518&idiq=4779215), about an owl that just wants to go to bed on time. Relatable.

Been on a Neal Stephenson kick. Re-enjoyed Cryptonomicon, and am now on Seveneves. In a nonfiction rut.

## Crying

That Shohei Ohtani is not a Chicago Cub.
