<p>Ten short weeks ago, I walked through this same airport. I was apprehensive of the situation: <a href="http://storify.com/laurenmichell/a-midwesterners-impressions-of-the-pacific-northwe">A brand new city</a>, a new job, not a soul within 20 hours’ drive that I personally knew. I put my Midwestern life on hold in pursuit of a strange career.</p>

<p>The Seattle Times is an intimidating place to a 20-year-old computer science major. It all seemed so frantic. (Not to mention, I can’t say how many times I had to timidly ask for directions to a meeting.)</p>
<p>But there I was, face-to-face with the untouchables who decide what is important enough to land on hundreds of thousands of doorsteps. A college junior, with little more than an eagerness to make an impact.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I survived.</p>
<p>The Seattle Times family could not have been more welcoming, and I will truly miss that. You all allowed my play to become my work, giving me the freedom to direct, the power to enable and the push to create my visions.</p>
<p>Lauren- I really cannot thank you enough for everything you’ve done to make me feel welcome. You helped me push for what I needed to do my best work, and you stood by me in my errors.</p>
<p>Dean- You were an eager learner, a great questioner and a hidden gem in our organization. I eagerly await the day when your talent is fully realized.</p>
<p>Eric- You were the boss I needed: A person with trust and understanding, and one willing to stick your neck out to defend me. You’ve been a fantastic mentor throughout, and I’ll lean on you for future advice.</p>
<p>Albert- I owe you big time. I don’t know how you always figured out a way to get me what I asked for (and maybe I don’t want to), but thanks. Without that, I’d just have been a waste of intern payroll.</p>
<p>Cheryl- You showed an eagerness to learn unmatched by most, and that motivated me. You’ll be a Pythonista before you know it.</p>
<p>Brian, Bettina, Genevieve, Katrina, Amy, Niko, Bob- You were all so supportive and dedicated time to my obscure requests.</p>
<p>And to everyone, including those I didn’t get to know as personally- You’ve been a wonderful family and have reinforced my desire to work in such an environment. You have all been friends, and that does not end today.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be happier with my decision to come to the Seattle Times this summer. My only wish is this: that the progress we have made in the past ten weeks does not fade, but accelerates into something we can all look back on and smile about.</p>
<p>It’s a day of mixed emotions, but the high of what we’ve accomplished overrides. Thanks for having me.</p>
