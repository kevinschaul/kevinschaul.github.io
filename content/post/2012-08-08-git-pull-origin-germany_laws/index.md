Germany is [posting its federal laws and regulations on GitHub](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze#german-federal-laws-and-regulations).

It works like and GitHub repo: Open issues, send pull requests and change branches all from the comfy GUI.

Wonder when a certain line in a law was added? There's a git command for that. Want to compare all financial law changes in years leading up to the collapse? Git has you covered.

I hope the sticks around long enough for people to see the real power of it.
