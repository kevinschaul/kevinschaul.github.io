<p>Germany is <a href="https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze#german-federal-laws-and-regulations">posting its federal laws and regulations on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It works like and GitHub repo: Open issues, send pull requests and change branches all from the comfy GUI.</p>
<p>Wonder when a certain line in a law was added? Thereâ€™s a git command for that. Want to compare all financial law changes in years leading up to the collapse? Git has you covered.</p>
<p>I hope the sticks around long enough for people to see the real power of it.</p>
