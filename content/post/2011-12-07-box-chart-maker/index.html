<p>I came up with a fun idea last night, on my everlasting quest to provide journalists with tools to create interactive graphics on their own.</p>
<p>Box chart maker is a simple tool for journalists who want to spice up their articles. Influenced by the <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/national/pardons/">wonderful presidential pardon interactive graphic</a> by the Washington Post, box chart maker helps non-technical people create beautiful, simple graphics.</p>
<p>Try out the <a href="http://kevin.schaul.io/projects/box-chart-maker/">live demo</a>, and give me some feedback. It’s pretty creaky (not at all user-friendly), but it isn’t bad for a day of coding between classes and life.</p>
<p>There are a ton of features I’d like to add. This is iterative development at its finest.</p>
<p>And seriously, if you have a better name, I’d love to hear it.</p>
