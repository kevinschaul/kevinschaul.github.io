## Playing

[Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) is so simple yet so hard to put down.
It looked weird to me at first. I’m not a poker player. But if you look up a
couple videos you will get hooked. The perfect brainteaser.

It’s even got me prototyping my own game. Hopefully I’ll have something to
share on that soon.

## Listening

[Kokoroko](https://kokoroko.bandcamp.com/album/could-we-be-more), who just
announced an upcoming tour. Go see them if you can!

We Be More by Kokoroko</a></iframe>

## Coding

I remain excited about
[jump-start](https://kschaul.com/post/2024/06/28/introducing-jump-start-a-shortcut-to-your-favorite-code/)
— my way of saving and sharing my favorite snippets of code.

## Watching

I can’t take my eyes of the Olympics sport climbing. The way they can read
boulder problems is inspiring. I don’t imagine I’ll be making the team.

## Reading

Upgrade by Blake Crouch has been a fun suspenseful read — er
[listen](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780593507186-upgrade). Perfect for summer
walks with the baby.
