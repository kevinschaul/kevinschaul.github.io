I keep a running log of how AI did on real tasks. Notes from the last few weeks: 🧵

Asked ChatGPT to find a recent paper about a small AI model that did well on arc agi. Was pleasantly surprised that it found it immediately ✔️ https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871

Asked ChatGPT to check an Amazon link daily and let me know when the item was available for purchase. Every morning I got a message that the item was available. It wasn't. Pretty annoying that stuff like that still doesn't work.✖️

Generated renderings of my dining room with different wallpapers while at the store. I find Image-to-image editing quite useful for stuff like this ✔️

Tried to find some cheap ram in Atlas browser. Did a bunch of impressive looking clicking and then made up fake prices. Nice.✖️ https://kschaul.com/link/2025-10-21_just_tried_out_atlas/

Even after using this stuff for years, I rarely know whether something is going to work until I try it. Just me?
