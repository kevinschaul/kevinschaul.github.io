## Reading

[Chip War](https://bookshop.org/p/books/chip-war-the-fight-for-the-world-s-most-critical-technology-chris-miller/18265375) is the best book I’ve read lately. Fascinating to learn how much government policy made Nikon, Samsung etc. what they are today (and their respective countries too).

My hold at the library finally came up on [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://bookshop.org/p/books/designing-data-intensive-applications-the-big-ideas-behind-reliable-scalable-and-maintainable-systems-martin-kleppmann/7861564), and it’s probably the best technical book I’ve ever read. Wonderfully balances the theoretical and the practical.

Also started [Rise and Fall of the Third Reich](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-third-reich-a-history-of-nazi-germany-william-l-shirer/15950699), because I know little about that time period but probably should!

## Playing

Still can’t stop playing Balatro, but I also picked up Slay the Spire. Less addicting but still a fun puzzle-y game.

## Listening

Everything by Sinj Clark but especially [Music for an Italian Afternoon](https://sinjclarke.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-an-italian-afternoon).

## Watching

Inside Out 2 and feeling so seen.
