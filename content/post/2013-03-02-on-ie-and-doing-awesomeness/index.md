<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>&quot;There has been little resistance from our readers to doing awesomeness.&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/nytgraphics">@nytgraphics</a>&#39;s Amanda Cox, on not always supporting IE <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nicar13&amp;src=hash">#nicar13</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Schaul (@kevinschaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinschaul/statuses/307577747402788864">March 1, 2013</a></blockquote>
