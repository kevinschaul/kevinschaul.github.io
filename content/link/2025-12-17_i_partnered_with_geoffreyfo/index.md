I partnered with 
[@geoffreyfowler.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:an3wpvygh4quekt2crxganap)
 to test a bunch of AI editing tools, and something ~very interesting~ happened.

We asked Gemini to generate a professional photo of an actor crying at the Oscars. It did — including a fake copyright notice from a real AP photographer.

Google said it was "refining" its safeguards. The AP didn't answer questions about whether Gemini had rights to train on its photos.
