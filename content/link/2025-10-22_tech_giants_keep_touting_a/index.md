Tech giants keep touting a system they built to label AI-generated content. But it only works if everyone uses it.

So I checked. They're not using it.

I generated a video with OpenAI's Sora and confirmed it had the Content Credentials metadata, which marks it as AI-generated. I posted it across social media. Every site stripped the metadata off my video. Only YouTube displayed any indication that it was synthetic (hidden behind a menu).

I also tested generating Sora clips using the API and could not believe the outputs have no visible watermark or Content Credentials metadata. I still don't know if that's on purpose or an oversight because they don't answer my emails.

Anyway, many more details in the article (and so much more to say than can fit in one article)
