Just released a plugin for `llm` to pull in U.S. legislation as fragments, enabling you to do stuff like:
`llm -f bill:hr1-119 'Anything AI-related in here?'` or `llm -f bill:hr1-119:section-110101 'Is there language in here to prevent fraud?'` --> [GitHub - kevinschaul/llm-fragments-us-legislation: Load bills from Congress.gov as LLM fragments](https://github.com/kevinschaul/llm-fragments-us-legislation)
