title: Extract FEMA incidents | LLM evals - Kevin Schaul
---

How reliable are LLMs at extracting data from pdfs? Inspired by

Just one model extracted the data from the pdf correctly: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview. --> [Extract FEMA incidents | LLM evals - Kevin Schaul](https://kschaul.com/llm-evals/evals/extract-fema-incidents/)
