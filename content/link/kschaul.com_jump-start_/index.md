Cooking on some improvements to my little tool jump-start: A shortcut to your favorite code. It's basically a directory of code you like, with a prebuilt web interface for exploring and downloading it. I've got a CLI and a neovim plugin starting to work, which I'm super excited about. Now I can search for starters by text or code. --> [@storybook/cli - Storybook](https://kschaul.com/jump-start/)
