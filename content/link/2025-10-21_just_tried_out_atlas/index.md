Just tried out Atlas (OpenAI's new browser). Asked it to find me some cheap ram.

3 mins later, it told me Microcenter's best price was $299. I checked manually (took 10s) and found one at $183. None are $299.

My lukewarm take is that this might work sometimes for some tasks. But woof are the privacy and security implications bad. The risk/reward is hopelessly unbalanced.
