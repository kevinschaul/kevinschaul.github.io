Google’s releasing an AI-powered code editor called Antigravity. Like a combination of Claude Code and an agentic web browser, but altogether in one GUI. 

[Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/blog/introducing-google-antigravity)

They’re really leaning into the idea that coders are gonna become AI managers. Rather than managing all your coding agents manually, there's an inbox with ongoing tasks. 

Unfortunately I ran out of credits halfway through my first task :(
