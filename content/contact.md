Kevin Schaul is a senior graphics reporter at the Washington Post. He graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in computer science, though all his professional work has been in newsrooms.

He grew up in the Windy City suburbs of Gurnee and Lake Forest, where he developed a deep love for Chicago Cubs baseball and deep dish pizza. In his free time, Kevin plays bass guitar in a beginner jazz combo.
