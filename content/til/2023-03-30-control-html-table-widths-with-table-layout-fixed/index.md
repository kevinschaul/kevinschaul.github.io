Just learned about the CSS property `table-layout: fixed;` that makes HTML table column widths follow sane rules. They will actually respect the width values you give them.

There are a lot of great usage examples [on this css tricks post](https://css-tricks.com/fixing-tables-long-strings/) from ... 2014. How did I not know about this?
