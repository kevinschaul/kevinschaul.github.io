# Box chart maker
By Kevin Schaul

Inspired by Washington Post's [presidential pardons interactive graphic](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/national/pardons/), here is a tool for journalists to easily create attractive box charts to compliment their stories.

Continued development as part of the [AP-Google Scholar program](http://journalists.org/2012/04/13/kevin-schaul-2012-ap-google-scholarship-recipient/).
