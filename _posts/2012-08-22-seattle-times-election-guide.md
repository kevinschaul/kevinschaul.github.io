blurb: There's nothing more frustrating than poor voter literacy. We built a responsive election guide for readers to find out information about their future legislators.

Four short weeks ago, Eric Ulken sat me down to divvy up the rest of my time at the Seattle Times. We'd been toying with a couple complex project ideas, but he wanted to be sure I'd have time to complete whatever we began by the end of my internship.

Well, we made it, and with two days to spare.

I'm pleased to finally unveil my summer internship pet project: [The Seattle Times Election Guide](http://elections.seattletimes.com).

From the about page:
The Seattle Times 2012 election guide was built to encourage better voter literacy at the polls. We've simplified getting the latest news and basic information for the candidates that matter most to you.

It's informative. It's local. It's responsive. It has the most beautiful iOS icon ever. (Credit Lauren Rabaino for that gem.)

It's a new form of journalism, a new way to bring value to the digital platform, a new way to present facts. It's a working example of what can happen with a healthy balance of direction and freedom to experiment.

It's the product of something journalism won't be saved without taking: a calculated risk.

Our team overcame many challenges, technical and otherwise, to produce a product that I am truly proud of.

The dream team has done it again, and I couldn't be luckier to work with them all (even that newcomer IT guy).

And if a single person decides to vote after using the app, it will all have been worth it.

Stay tuned for the technical details.
