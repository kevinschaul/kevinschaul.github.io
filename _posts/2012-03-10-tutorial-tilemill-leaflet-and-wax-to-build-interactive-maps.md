Earlier this week, MinnPost published an [interactive map showing same-day registrations](http://www.minnpost.com/data/2012/03/mapping-voter-same-day-registrations-minnesota) in precincts throughout Minnesota. Here, we walk through how we made it happen &mdash; both to document our work and, we hope, to help others who might be interested in building something similar.
