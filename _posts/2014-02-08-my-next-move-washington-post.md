I'll be kicking off my career with the Washington Post as a graphics
editor, and I am absolutely thrilled.

In a few short months, I will be working alongside some of the world's
best journalists in a newsroom investing heavily in digital. It will be
a great chance to grow my skills [among a stellar team of visual
thinkers, data crunchers and map makers](http://postgraphics.tumblr.com/).

Leaving the Star Tribune won't be easy. Our team made great progress
over the past year, exposing the newsroom to some of the possibilities
data-driven journalism gives us. They truly are a great bunch, and I
hope they got as much out of my experience there as I got out of working
with them.

My role will begin part time in April from Minneapolis as I finish up my
computer science degree. I'll transition to full time when I move to
Washington in early June. D.C. pro tips are very welcome.
