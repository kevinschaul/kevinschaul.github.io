Those were the words I heard the other day, from Seattle Times photojournalist [Bettina Hansen](http://bettinahansen.com/). With today's technology, everyone is a pro at taking photos. Shell out $600 for a decent DSLR and watch a 15 minute YouTube tutorial video, and you'll impress your friends with the results.

Of course, there's much more to photography than buying good equipment and learning a few tricks. Our photographers produce fantastic photojournalism – Bettina included.

But her statement got me thinking: Can the same be said for programmers?

We're moving to a state where nearly everyone in the newsroom can perform basic functions on a computer. Some are even more literate than my fellow computer science majors. But almost none have the formal technology education. With sources like [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), it's easier than ever to become fluent in programming concepts.

I hope that one day, in the same sense, there will be no such thing as a professional programmer.
