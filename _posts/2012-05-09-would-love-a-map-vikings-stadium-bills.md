The last few days have been bewildering for anyone following the Vikings stadium debacle. Late last night, the Minnesota Senate passed a version of a bill, and the night before, the House did the same. As I watched Tweetdeck fill in with updates all day, one tweet came called me to action:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kevinschaul">@kevinschaul</a> Would love a map! (Probably too much to ask for on quick turnaround). <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Vikings&amp;src=hash">#Vikings</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mnleg&amp;src=hash">#mnleg</a></p>&mdash; David Brauer (@dbrauer) <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrauer/statuses/199888613180313600">May 8, 2012</a></blockquote>

I got to work. Well, I actually went to my machine architecture final exam (don't worry, I aced it) (jinx) and _then_ started the map. Once the Senate passed their version, I made a csv file of votes and threw it onto a second map.

See the maps [here](http://www.kevinschaul.com/projects/vikings-bill-voters/house/).

The votes aren't too interesting in terms of location, but we wouldn't know until we tried.

If you want to build something like this, [my tutorial for MinnPost](http://www.minnpost.com/data/2012/03/how-we-built-same-day-registration-map) would do well.

And as always, you can find the code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/kevinschaul/vikings-bill-voters).
