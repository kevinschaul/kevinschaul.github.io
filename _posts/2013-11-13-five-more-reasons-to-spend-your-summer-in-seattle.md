Last year's intern Jon Schleuss nailed [the top five reasons to spend
your summer in
Seattle](http://www.jschleuss.com/2013/11/13/why-you-should-spend-your-summer-in-seattle/).
Here's my lame attempt to make it a top ten list.

### 10. If you're passionate, you're qualified
I came in to the office with mediocre programming skills and a
lackluster understanding of real-world journalism. As the media world
changes, the desire to learn is the differentiating skill; the rest is
secondary.

### 9. You already have family in Seattle
The people at the Seattle Times are unbelievably welcoming, friendly and
helpful. Sure, they have their quirks, but what family doesn't? I moved
there without knowing a soul in the state. I'm a shy person. But
somehow, the folks at work got me out nearly every weekend. I'll never
lose contact with them; that isn't something many internships can offer.

### 8. They're serious about digital journalism
It's clear that the Seattle Times management is realizing that data
journalism is a big deal. There's now a team dedicated to producing
great digital journalism, headed up by [one of the industry's best](https://twitter.com/laurenrabaino).

### 7. Attend meetings, change your major
I learned more about journalism by going to the daily news meetings than
in my two years of journalism coursework. (I ended up dropping the major
completely after I realized I had been involved in the kinds of
decisions my professors lectured about.) My bosses didn't mind if I
wasn't producing something to help the company's bottom line. It was a
learning experience through-and-through.

### 6. Bring your pet projects and watch them grow
Large companies aren't known for flexibility and openness to experiment,
but my coworkers helped me find a way to disrupt their routine. I told
my boss about [my pie-in-the-sky project
idea](http://kevin.schaul.io/2012/08/22/seattle-times-election-guide/),
and we executed it *without tradeoffs*. Talk about getting great clips.

Still not convinced? Take a look at [Jon's
