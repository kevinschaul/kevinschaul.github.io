      <description>To stay sharp while on parental leave, I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with writing a chess engine. A bad one.
I am truly awful at chess. I know how the pieces are allowed to move, but that&amp;rsquo;s it. If I am lucky enough to find myself ahead in an endgame, you can just move around randomly. I&amp;rsquo;ll never figure out how to checkmate you.
But writing a program to play chess better than I can sounds &amp;hellip; pretty doable?</description>
