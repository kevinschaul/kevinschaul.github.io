      <description>Most of The Washington Post has moved to React for site rendering. This is hugely beneficial overall but for many graphics reporters it’s yet another thing to learn to get stories published.
It’s already overwhelming to learn HTML/CSS/JS, data analysis, some way to build charts, some mapping tool. I’m interested in lowering the barriers to entry for this field.
Fortunately there’s a fairly simple pattern we can build into our tooling to bring back some simplicity of the pre-React frontend development.</description>

      <title>Coloring emoji/unicode characters on iOS Safari</title>

      <description>Unicode characters such as ■ (black square U+25A0) can be super useful to use for icons without needing to load an icon font. And they can typically be styled using CSS, like: color: steelblue;.
But on iOS safari (and likely Android and other devices), these are rendered in the cartooney, emoji style — which means trying to color them with CSS doesn’t work.
Fortunately there is an easy (but cryptic) fix: Simply append &amp;amp;#xFE0E; immediately following your unicode character, like ■&amp;amp;#xFE0E;.</description>
