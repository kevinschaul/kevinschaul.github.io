  <p>I write a lot of code, for work and for fun. But I often feel myself writing the same code, or setting up a project in the same way, again and again.</p>
<p>This code isn&rsquo;t perfect. It&rsquo;s not worth packaging up and releasing. It&rsquo;s often not even worth putting in some GitHub repository that I&rsquo;ll inevitably forget about. It&rsquo;s just some code that I like having easily accessible. And I think I&rsquo;ve finally figured out a way to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling the system <code>jump-start</code>. It&rsquo;s a lightweight system to organize that code that you keep coming back to. Itâ€™s a structured GitHub repository and a web frontend. Here&rsquo;s mine <a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start">on GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.kschaul.com/jump-start">on my website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-starter">Using a starter</h2>
<p><img src="storybook.png" alt="Screenshot of jump-start on my website"></p>
<p>Above is a screenshot of my starter for creating a React component that draws a line chart using d3. I write code like this very often, but it is not something I want to package up. The flexibility of tweaking this chart is crucial. With <code>jump-start</code>, now when I need to write some code to draw a line chart, I can locate the command on my website:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>npx tiged kevinschaul/jump-start/react-d3/LineChart
</code></pre><p>Running this command will drop the contents of my <a href="https://www.kschaul.com/jump-start/?path=/docs/react-d3-linechart--docs">react-d3/LineChart starter</a> into the current directory. Go ahead, try it!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve currently got starters for <a href="https://www.kschaul.com/jump-start/?path=/docs/r-data-analysis--docs">data analysis in R</a>, <a href="https://www.kschaul.com/jump-start/?path=/docs/node-cli--docs">building a CLI in node</a>, <a href="https://www.kschaul.com/jump-start/?path=/docs/geo-pmtiles-counties--docs">building county-level map tiles</a>, and a few others. We&rsquo;ve got a shared <code>jump-start</code> set up at work, as a quick place people can share reusable scripts or React components that aren&rsquo;t quite ready to be moved officially into our template.</p>
<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</h2>
<p>The beauty of this system, to me, is its simplicity. It&rsquo;s just a git repository with directories of code snippets, each denoted by the <code>jump-start.yaml</code> file.</p>
<p><img src="tree.png" alt="A directory of files"></p>
<p>Adding a new starter takes <a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-starter">just a few minutes</a>. The GitHub readme and the website update automatically, thanks to some logic in <a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start-tools">jump-start-tools</a>.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-your-own-jump-start">Set up your own jump-start</h2>
<p>I tried to make it easy to start your own <code>jump-start</code> instance: Just use <a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start-template">this GitHub template</a>. This will set up everything, including the GitHub action that rewrites the readme and deploys the site to GitHub pages. Alternatively you can fork <a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start">mine</a>, but be warned &ndash; you might not like the same code I like!</p>
<h2 id="possibly-future-improvements">Possibly future improvements</h2>
<p>I like this setup so far, but I wonder if there is room to improve. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m considering building a <code>jump-start</code> CLI that hides some of the <code>tiged</code> unweildliness. I think it would be really nice to be able to <code>jump-start LineChart</code>, or <code>jump-start work/SharedChart</code>. It could also keep track of which starters you&rsquo;ve used, support autocomplete and other nice features. But that would require a lot of CLI design, and I&rsquo;m not sure how necessary it is.</li>
<li>For shared <code>jump-start</code> instances, like teamwide ones, it would be great to know which starters are getting the most use, or let people upvote them.</li>
<li>I wish there were a page that showed screenshots of all of the starter previews. I could see that being really nice for web components.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you try <code>jump-start</code> out, let me know what you think of it? I&rsquo;m eager to hear.</p>
