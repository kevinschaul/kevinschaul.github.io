<p>In yesterday’s New York Times, I ran across <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html">an unusual opinion piece on gerrymandering</a>. Sam Wang, the column’s author, made his argument with data.</p>
<p>“Using statistical tools that are common in fields like my own, neuroscience, I have found strong evidence that this historic aberration arises from partisan disenfranchisement,” Wang said. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/03/sunday-review/imbalance-of-power.html">A graphic ran alongside the piece</a> further explaining Wang’s statistical findings.</p>
<p>Of course, statistics (in traditional and visual forms) can be a wonderful tool to removing emotion from reality and giving us a raw version of what’s really happening. But we also know that statistics and visualizations can be used to mislead.</p>
<p>So, do statistics and graphics belong in the opinion section?</p>
<p>My initial reaction is that they absolutely do. The public already takes an extremely critical view of anything published by a news company. Readers should treat a data-driven piece no differently. Opinion writers have the duty to promote worthwhile discussion and encourage change, and the best do this by admitting anything worth debating is not black-and-white. Statistical methods are powerful and must be used to enhance this discussion, not to alter truth.</p>
<p>I see it as an ethical duty of opinion writers to be fair about their data, just as they shouldn’t mislead with anything they write. For complete clarity, I would have liked to see both Wang and graphics editor Bill Marsh publish their methodology in a related post.</p>
<p>The technique is young, but it isn’t likely to go away. I’d love more discussion on this.</p>
