      <description>Getting on the &amp;ldquo;Recently&amp;rdquo; blog post train. Time will tell how long this lasts &amp;hellip;
Listening Been seeing a lot of love for Yussef Dayes&amp;rsquo;s debut solo record: Black Classical Music. It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic. But for even more electric drumming, for me it&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat his live set at Joshua Tree:

      <title>Writing a bad chess engine</title>

      <description>To stay sharp while on parental leave, I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with writing a chess engine. A bad one.
I am truly awful at chess. I know how the pieces are allowed to move, but that&amp;rsquo;s it. If I am lucky enough to find myself ahead in an endgame, you can just move around randomly. I&amp;rsquo;ll never figure out how to checkmate you.
But writing a program to play chess better than I can sounds &amp;hellip; pretty doable?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a library to help chart-makers avoid text overlaps in their graphics, and it&amp;rsquo;s finally in a place worth sharing. Check it out on GitHub or in action at two of my recent graphics.
Labeling charts, maps and other graphics is more art than science, but there are some general rules we can follow to achieve good results programmatically. This library provides two label-avoidance techniques: nudge and choices.</description>

      <description>My colleagues and I recently published this analysis of 15 million websites in a commonly used AI training dataset. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little bit about how we did it.
Allen Institute researchers kindly provided us with the top 1,000 domains in Googleâ€™s C4 dataset. But that was just 8% of tokens, hardly representative. So they then pulled all 15.7M domains. We planned to categorize the top 1,000 websites by hand, but all 15.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been diverting much of my web browsing away from social media and towards RSS feeds, but there are so many sites that don&amp;rsquo;t offer the feeds for the content I care about.
Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a side project called Feedmaker (Source on GitHub). It&amp;rsquo;s a service that lets you generate RSS feeds from websites in next to no time. Just figure out a couple CSS selectors and pass them as URL parameters.</description>
