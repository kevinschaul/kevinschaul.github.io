<p>A few months ago, my colleague and fellow beer lover <a href="https://twitter.com/chavens">Chris
Havens</a> noticed an interesting fact: that
Minnesota was among the nation’s leaders in craft brewery growth. Chris
and I knew we had stumbled upon a great opportunity — we just
didn’t know what it was.</p>
<p>Around the same time, <a href="http://flowingdata.com">FlowingData</a> picked up on a
<a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/12/k-means-clustering-86-single-malt-scotch-whiskies.html">great
post</a>
on clustering 86 types of whiskey, which included a fantastic dataset that was
begging to be visualized. I built a <a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/d3-star-plot">star plot
generator</a> in d3, which my future
colleague Christopher Ingraham soon expanded into <a href="http://wonkviz.tumblr.com/post/72159021235/whiskey-flavor-profiles">a beautiful visual
representation of the
whiskey</a>.
(Chris <a href="http://wonkviz.tumblr.com/post/72400253092/whiskey-data-sleuthing-with-help-from-reddit">later found the source for the
data</a>
— quite the tale.)</p>
<p>I showed Chris Havens, and we immediately saw the underpinnings for the graphic
we finally published: <a href="http://apps.startribune.com/news/20140313-beer-me-minnesota/">Beer Me,
Minnesota!</a> With
more than 50 breweries currently operating in Minnesota (and no indication of
that trend soon reversing), we hoped to guide readers through the influx of
local craft beer.</p>
<div id="build-your-own-dataset" class="section level3">
<h3>Build-your-own-dataset</h3>
<p>Great data visualization requires great data, and no such set existed for
attributes of local craft beer. To ease compilation of the information, Chris
and I built a <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809">Google Form</a> to
send to local brewers. We weren’t initially sure what we would be doing
with the data, but many brewers were trusting enough to respond with
information about their favorite brews. We had to be a bit cautious in forming
questions, though, since <a href="http://apps.startribune.com/news/20140313-beer-me-minnesota/brews.csv">the
data</a>
would be self-reported by the brewers.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-math-behind-the-matchmaker" class="section level3">
<h3>The math behind the matchmaker</h3>
<p>Our matchmaker is surprisingly simple mathematically. When the user searches,
the code uses a version of the distance formula to find the closest match.</p>
<p>In a two-dimensional world, the distance between two points is:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="distance.gif" alt="" />
<p class="caption">distance</p>
</div>
<p>It’s easy to expand the distance formula to a generic world of <code>n</code>
dimensions:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="distance-n.gif" alt="" />
<p class="caption">distance-n</p>
</div>
<p>Of course, our beer world had five dimensions: IBUs, SRM, Aroma, ABV, and Body.
Since these attributes had different ranges, we first had to normalize them.
Otherwise, a 10-point difference in IBUs would mask a 0.10 difference in ABV,
though the latter is more substantial.</p>
<p>The mathematics in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>// Distances will be saved in a two-dimensional array. The first
// dimension will be the source node, and the second will be the
// destination. The value will be the distance between them.
var distances = [];
_.each(normalized, function(src) {
  distances[src.i] = [];
  _.each(normalized, function(dst) {
    distances[src.i][dst.i] = Math.sqrt(
      Math.pow((src.n_abv - dst.n_abv) / 100, 2) +
      Math.pow((src.n_ibu - dst.n_ibu) / 100, 2) +
      Math.pow((src.n_body - dst.n_body) / 100, 2) +
      Math.pow((src.n_aroma - dst.n_aroma) / 100, 2) +
      Math.pow((src.n_srm - dst.n_srm) / 100, 2)
    );
  });
});</code></pre>
<p>Visualizing the data was simple with
<a href="https://github.com/kevinschaul/d3-star-plot"><code>d3.starPlot()</code></a>, which I refined
over the course of the project. To introduce readers to this type of chart, we
live-visualized their attribute choices. On slider <code>change</code>, I called the
following function:</p>
<pre><code>function updateCustomChart() {
  innerChart
    .datum({
      abv: customVal.abv,
      srm: customVal.srm,
      ibu: customVal.ibu,
      body: customVal.body,
      aroma: customVal.aroma
    })
    .call(customStar)

  innerChart.selectAll(&#39;.star-path&#39;)
    .style(&#39;fill&#39;, function(d) {
      return srmColor(d.srm);
    });
}</code></pre>
<p>It’s pretty simple, but to fun (and surprisingly helpful) effect. I leave
building a national version as an exercise for the reader.</p>
