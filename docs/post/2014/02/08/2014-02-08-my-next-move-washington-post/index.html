<p>I’ll be kicking off my career with the Washington Post as a graphics
editor, and I am absolutely thrilled.</p>
<p>In a few short months, I will be working alongside some of the world’s
best journalists in a newsroom investing heavily in digital. It will be
a great chance to grow my skills <a href="http://postgraphics.tumblr.com/">among a stellar team of visual
thinkers, data crunchers and map makers</a>.</p>
<p>Leaving the Star Tribune won’t be easy. Our team made great progress
over the past year, exposing the newsroom to some of the possibilities
data-driven journalism gives us. They truly are a great bunch, and I
hope they got as much out of my experience there as I got out of working
with them.</p>
<p>My role will begin part time in April from Minneapolis as I finish up my
computer science degree. I’ll transition to full time when I move to
Washington in early June.</p>
<p>All pro tips on living in the D.C. area are much appreciated.</p>
