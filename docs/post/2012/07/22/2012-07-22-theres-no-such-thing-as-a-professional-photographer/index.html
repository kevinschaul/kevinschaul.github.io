<p>Those were the words I heard the other day, from Seattle Times photojournalist <a href="http://bettinahansen.com/">Bettina Hansen</a>. With today’s technology, everyone is a pro at taking photos. Shell out $600 for a decent DSLR and watch a 15 minute YouTube tutorial video, and you’ll impress your friends with the results.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s much more to photography than buying good equipment and learning a few tricks. Our photographers produce fantastic photojournalism – Bettina included.</p>
<p>But her statement got me thinking: Can the same be said for programmers?</p>
<p>We’re moving to a state where nearly everyone in the newsroom can perform basic functions on a computer. Some are even more literate than my fellow computer science majors. But almost none have the formal technology education. With sources like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, it’s easier than ever to become fluent in programming concepts.</p>
<p>I hope that one day, in the same sense, there will be no such thing as a professional programmer.</p>
