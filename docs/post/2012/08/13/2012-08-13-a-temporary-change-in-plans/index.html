<p>This morning I accepted a different type of job. I’ll be a photographer at the University of Minnesota’s award-winning student newspaper: The Minnesota Daily.</p>
<p>The Daily was my jump start into journalism two years ago. I began as a copy editor and slid into the online manager position a few months later.</p>
<p>Besides being something I’ve always wanted to do, practicing photojournalism will give me editorial experience I lack and will still be relevant to my long-term digital goals.</p>
<p>We’ll be experimenting with different visual story formats, blogging about how we do what we do and optimizing our workflow.</p>
<p>I’ll be put out of my comfort zone and my area of expertise.</p>
<p>I’ll be one step closer to a full understanding of journalism.</p>
