      <description>Getting on the &amp;ldquo;Recently&amp;rdquo; blog post train. Time will tell how long this lasts &amp;hellip;
Listening Been seeing a lot of love for Yussef Dayes&amp;rsquo;s debut solo record: Black Classical Music. It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic. But for even more electric drumming, for me it&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat his live set at Joshua Tree:

      <title>Writing a bad chess engine</title>

      <description>To stay sharp while on parental leave, I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with writing a chess engine. A bad one.
I am truly awful at chess. I know how the pieces are allowed to move, but that&amp;rsquo;s it. If I am lucky enough to find myself ahead in an endgame, you can just move around randomly. I&amp;rsquo;ll never figure out how to checkmate you.
But writing a program to play chess better than I can sounds &amp;hellip; pretty doable?</description>

      <title>Create a montage of images in random order with imagemagick</title>

      <description>It ain&amp;rsquo;t pretty but this will let you use ImageMagick&amp;rsquo;s montage command with a random order of images.
First, generate a text file with the image filenames in it, in random order. The sed commands put a &amp;quot; character at the beginning and end of the filename, otherwise ImageMagick freaks out.
ls my-images | \ shuf | \ sed &amp;#39;s/^/&amp;#34;/&amp;#39; | \ sed &amp;#39;s/$/&amp;#34;/&amp;#39; &amp;gt; \ randomly_ordered_images.txt Then use that file of filenames as input, using the @ operator.</description>

      <title>Formatting numbers in javascript with Intl.NumberFormat()</title>

      <description>When formatting numbers for readability, say in a table, I&amp;rsquo;ve typically used d3-format. But I could never get it to do exactly what I wanted.
Well I just learned there&amp;rsquo;s a built-in for this now: Intl.NumberFormat(). The constructor takes two arguments: A locale (like &amp;rsquo;en-us&amp;rsquo;)`, and an extensive set of options. You can almost certainly get this to format numbers exactly how you want them.
In my case, I wanted 62,829,251,930 to become 62.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a library to help chart-makers avoid text overlaps in their graphics, and it&amp;rsquo;s finally in a place worth sharing. Check it out on GitHub or in action at two of my recent graphics.
Labeling charts, maps and other graphics is more art than science, but there are some general rules we can follow to achieve good results programmatically. This library provides two label-avoidance techniques: nudge and choices.</description>

      <title>Run a command when files change</title>

      <description>TIL about entr, a command that lets you run arbitrary commands whenever files change.
I was working on a project where I had to run a build command whenever I saved a file. Once I installed entr (brew install entr), it took me about 5 seconds to figure out how to use it for this purpose.
find apple-news/ | entr -s &amp;#39;npm run bespoke&amp;#39; Any time a tile inside the directory apple-news changes, npm run bespoke gets run.</description>
