  <h2>About</h2>

    Kevin Schaul is a senior graphics reporter at the Washington Post. He graduated from
    the University of Minnesota with a degree in computer science, though all
    his professional work has been in newsrooms.

    He grew up in the Windy City suburbs of Gurnee and Lake Forest, where he
    developed a deep love for Chicago Cubs baseball and deep dish pizza. In his free
    time, Kevin plays bass guitar in a beginner jazz combo.
